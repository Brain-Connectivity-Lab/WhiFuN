# WhiFuN
This GUI-based toolbox offers researchers a user-friendly suite of automated tools for investigating brain functional connectivity in WM and GM. One of the key advantages of WhiFuN is that it fully automates the preprocessing steps to derive data that can be used to analyze the WM and GM BOLD signals.

### Follow these steps to get started

1) Download WhiFuN in a local folder and unzip all the contents (Download WhiFuN by clicking on the green 'Code' button and then selecting Download zip)
2) Open MATLAB and addpath of the WhifuN toobox to MATLAB
   
     i) by using the addpath function
       just type ' addpath('<path to the WhiFuN folder>\WhiFuN-main\WhiFuN-main') ' in MATLAB command window and press enter;
   
   or
   
     ii) Click home when you are on the main screen of MATLAB (top left) and then under the environment section click on 'set path'. Next click on 'Add Folder' and select the WhiFuN-main folder that has the whifun.m code and click on 'Select folder'. Finally click 'save' and then 'close'.

3) If SPM12 toolbox is not downloaded, Please download the SPM12 toolbox from https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download/ , and addpath of the spm toolbox in MATLAB
   
     i) by using the addpath function
       just type ' addpath('<path to the SPM folder>\spm12\spm12') ' in MATLAB command window and press enter;
   
   or
   
     ii) Click home when you are on the main screen of MATLAB (top left) and then under the environment section click on 'set path'. Next click on 'Add Folder' and select the SPM folder that has the spm.m code and click on 'Select folder'. Finally click 'save' and then 'close'.

4) Once all the paths are set, type 'whifun' in MATLAB command and press enter.
5) The main GUI window of WhiFuN will open.

   i) Now first Select the Output folder button and select an empty folder where all the outputs and quality control plots will be saved. Alternatively one can also paste the path of the output folder on the text field besides the Output folder button.

   ii) Click the 'Select Data Folder' button and select the folder that has all the subjects folders. As an example, we show how WhiFuN can be used with some practice data that can be downloaded here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l7dhG8dYYRCW5EWhkPZbBpA7TOau1W-B?usp=sharing .
